Welcome to the CMA Project!
=====================================

The Cancer Molecular Analysis (CMA) portal enables researchers to use a single interface to integrate, visualize, and explore clinical and genomic characterization data from translational research studies, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project supported by the NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), as well as NCI's REMBRANDT (Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data), which will be added by the end of 2008.

The CMA portal provides web access to tools for the analysis and visualization of gene expression, gene copy number, SNP data, methylation data and DNA sequence. The molecular data can be analyzed within the context of clinical information, including treatment history, pathology status, tumor site and surgical history. The CMA homepage provides a feedback link to encourage user input on functionality and ease of use. 

The CMA is an Open Source project and it is written in Grails, Java and Groovy.
