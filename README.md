Welcome to the CMA Project!
=====================================

The Cancer Molecular Analysis (CMA) portal enables researchers to use a single interface to integrate, visualize, and explore clinical and genomic characterization data from translational research studies.The CMA portal provides web access to tools for the analysis and visualization of gene expression, gene copy number, SNP data, methylation data and DNA sequence. The molecular data can be analyzed within the context of clinical information.

The CMA is an Open Source project and it is written in Grails, Java and Groovy.
